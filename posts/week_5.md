## 10/12/20

Each presidential election, campaigns spend large sums of money on advertisement alone. Since September 5th, total TV ad spending sponsored by Biden and Trump totals over 136 million dollars [(Wesleyan Media Project)](https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-100120/). **What effect will advertisement spending have on the 2020 election?**

Even with hundreds of millions of dollars being spent, the effects of ads are still not entirely clear as the effects of advertisements are difficult to isolate. In a randomized experiment of media ad spending during the 2006 reelection campaign of Texas governor Rick Perry, Gerber et al. found strong evidence of the rapidly decaying effect of advertising [(Gerber et al.)](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-large-and-longlasting-are-the-persuasive-effects-of-televised-campaign-ads-results-from-a-randomized-field-experiment/DA29FE8A5581C772006A1DEBB21CFC4C). They suggest that ads prime people for various considerations when they are going to evaluate a candidate, but are not where people really learn about candidates in the long term. This emphasizes the importance of timing of ad spending. 

Huber et al. exploited the accidental experimental condition of media markets that overlap into nonbattleground states to examine the effects of campaign advertisments [(Huber et al.)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00291.x). They found that advertisements have much more of a persuasive effect than they do mobilizing or informing effects on voters. There is a subset of the population, however, that is persuadable, made up of people who are engaged enough to be exposed to campaign information, but not so engaged as to where they already have strong beliefs [(Huber et al.)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00291.x). 

Huber et al. also discuss the implications of their findings generally for the democratic process. They suggest that the tone and purpose of advertisments are important in considering the ways in which advertisements are actually persuasive [(Huber et al.)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00291.x). Rather than a focus on issues and policies, by an increased focus on contrasting and attacking the opposition, ads may actually only be persuasive about the character of candidates.

Trends in tone and purpose of campaigns since 2000 are visualized below.

There is a clear increased count of advertisements over the years. Although policy dominates the purpose of ads through these four elections, both policy and personal advertisements have also continued to trend upwards.

An interesting trend to note is also the fact that Democratic ad spending strongly outweighs Republican ad spending in years the Democratic party is the challenger. (Perhaps this is indicative of awareness of the [incumbency advantage?](https://cassidybargell.github.io/election_analytics/posts/week_4.html)).

It has been abundantly clear normal predictive measures are not proving extremel useful given the incredibly unique circumstances of 2020. One might think that advertisements could be something that could be considered relatively stable this year, however I would argue that this might not be as true as expected. 

Social media usage has continued to skyrocket since 2016. From 2016 to 2019 there was an increase of over 600,000,000 million users on Facebook [(https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media)](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media). Tiktok, a popular video app was created in 2016 and has already proven a controversial topic in American politics [("Trump Administration to Ban TikTok and WeChat From U.S. App Stores")](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/business/trump-tik-tok-wechat-ban.html). What roll will social media play in the 2020 election? The hard part about prediction using this data is that there is little historical information to compare this election to. Looking at trends can still provide insight about how social media has increasingly become an important facet of advertisement in election campaigns.
