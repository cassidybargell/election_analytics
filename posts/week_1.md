# Past Presidential Elections
## 9/14/20

An understanding of the past is a critical component of being able to make predictions about the future. So, what can we learn from past elections that might inform our understanding of the upcoming 2020 election? 

The two major parties, Democratic and Republican, have been in close competition for the presidency for many election cycles. Since 1948, the margin of difference in the two party vote share has not exceeded 24% (the largest being in 1972 with a difference of 23.58% in favor of the Republican candidate). Three elections have been within a 1% difference: 1960 with a 0.174% advantage to the Democratic candidate, 1968 with a 0.809% advantage to the Republican candidate, and in 2000 with a 0.519% difference in favor of the Democratic candidate. The trend in differences between percentage split of the two party poular vote share can below:

It seems as though margins have decreased in more recent elections. The last time the difference in two-party popular vote share exceeded 10% was in 1984 with the election of Republican Ronald Reagan.
